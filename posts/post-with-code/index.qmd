## Title 1
:::{.callout-warning}

Note that I'm really only interested in the session info and which packages were attached (ie via `library(pkgname)`), so I'll use the `pkgs = "attached"` argument. This flexibility is nice!

:::

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
#| fig-label: "ggplot"
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = factor(cyl))) +
    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = I(4 / 10)) +
    labs(x = "Highway mileage (miles per gallon)", y = "Displacement") +
    scale_colour_discrete(name = "Number of\ncylinders") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14, color = "#3f3f3f", face = "bold"),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12)
    )

```
