### Obtaining the fictional data from Mockeroo

For this exercise I created a set of fictional records of person in hospital with common respiratory virus infections. The data are not in any way representative of the epidemiology of the respiratoey viruses. It's all made up.

The data can be downloaded from this [mockeroo schema](https://www.mockaroo.com/6c4871a0)

The data will be used for a series of posts about data manipulation, and visulisation of data with graphs and tables.

The features of the fictional data are:

  * `id` - each record has a unique identifier
  * `sex` - sex of case (male or female)
  * `date_of_birth` - self-explanatory, 1% are `NA`
  * `condition` - the respiratory pathogen name. These are weighted, most are COVID-19 and influenza
  * `hospital` - the hospital where the case was detected
  * `admission_date` - date admitted to hospital
  * `discharge_date` - randmly set to within 12 days of admission

### Load the data and group it by hospital and condition

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}


library(tidyverse)
library(gt)

resp <- read_csv("respiratory.csv")


# Group data by hospital and pathogen
resp_hosp_group <- resp %>% 
    group_by(hospital, condition) %>% 
    tally() %>% 
    arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from = condition, values_from = n) %>% 
    ungroup() 



```
### Use the grouped data to make a `gt` table

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

#  Make a nice table
resp_hosp_group %>% 
    gt() %>% 
    tab_header(
        title = "Common respiratory pathogens in fictional hospitals between 1 Jan 2021 and 30 June 2022",
        subtitle = md("Data generated from [mockeroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/6c4871a0)")
        ) %>% 
    opt_align_table_header(align = "left") %>%
    cols_label(
        `Respiratory syncytial virus` = "RSV",
        `Parainfluenza virus` = "Parainfluenza",
        hospital = "Hospital"
    ) %>% 
    tab_footnote(
        footnote = "Respiratory syncytial virus",
        locations = cells_column_labels(
            columns = c(`Respiratory syncytial virus`)
        )
    ) %>%
    tab_footnote(
        footnote = "Includes human parainfluenza subtypes 1, 2, and 3",
        locations = cells_column_labels(
            columns = c(
                `Parainfluenza virus`
            )
        )
    ) %>%
    opt_footnote_marks(marks = c("*", "#", "^",  "~")) %>% 
    cols_align(align = c("left"), columns = everything()) %>%
    cols_align(align = c("right"), columns = where(is.numeric)) %>% 
    cols_width(hospital ~ px(150),
        everything() ~ px(120)) %>% 
    tab_style(
        locations = cells_column_labels(),
        style = list(
            cell_fill("#183C5D"),
            cell_text("#FFFFFF", weight = 500)
        ) 
    ) %>% 
    tab_style(
        locations = cells_body(
            columns = hospital
        ),
        style = list(
            cell_fill("#0F5CA2"),
            cell_text("#FFFFFF", weight = 500)
        ) 
    )  %>% 
    tab_style(
      locations = cells_body(),
      style = list(
         cell_text(size = 6, weight = 500)
      )
    )
    



```
